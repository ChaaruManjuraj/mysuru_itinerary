## Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary

Don't miss Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, a haven for birdwatchers, located just outside of Mysuru. This protected area is known as the *"Pakshi Kashi of Karnataka"* (the Kashi of birds) for a reason! While it's a great year-round destination, visiting towards the end of May means you might catch the tail end of the winter migratory birds before they head back North. This boosts the already impressive resident birdlife, giving you the chance to see a wider variety of species during your visit.
